Welcome to the 15122 Physics Mechanics Lab!

Description: the 15112 Physics Mechanics Laboratory is a program where users can create their own physics models
using a variety of different objects, including ramps, balls, blocks, springs, and frictional surfaces.
Users will be able to complete one of three set experiments (collisions, forces with blocks on pulleys, 
and projectile motion) or play around with various components in the physics sandbox mode.

How to run the program: to run the program, please run the __main__.py file

Libraries: none

Shortcuts: there are a few shortcuts in the sandbox
- 'l' to reduce all ball velocities to zero
- 'c' to change item
